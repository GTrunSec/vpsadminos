  IP address and route management for routed interfaces has been separated.
  It is now possible to route larger networks and assign only selected host
  addresses to the container's interfaces. As a consequence, all IP addresses
  must have a route in order to be reachable. osctld can create routes
  automatically for newly assigned addresses, but existing containers need to
  be reconfigured so that its addresses are routed as expected. This migration
  creates routes for all container IP addresses assigned to routed interfaces.

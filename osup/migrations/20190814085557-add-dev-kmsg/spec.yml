  Adds /dev/kmsg device (major=1 minor=11) to the root group with all access
  allowed. The device is needed as an interface to syslog with syslog namespace
  enabled.
  
  Note that the device is left alone on rollback. It is up to the administrator
  to remove it. The device may be required in some configurations, which we
  don't want to break. The command to remove it is

    osctl group devices del <pool>:/ char 1 11
